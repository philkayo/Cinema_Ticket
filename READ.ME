Cinema Ticket Service

TicketServiceImpl Overview
The TicketServiceImpl class is designed to handle ticket purchases while ensuring validation,
 cost calculation, and seamless interaction with external services for payment and seat reservations.

Key Methods
purchaseTickets: This method validates the account ID and ticket requests,
ensures compliance with purchase rules (such as the maximum number of tickets),calculates the total cost,
processes the payment, and reserves the appropriate number of seats.
validateTicketRequests: Validates that ticket requests are reasonable, ensuring no more than 25 tickets are purchased,
 and enforces the requirement that at least one adult must be included when children or infant tickets are requested.
calculateTotalAmount: Calculates the total amount to be paid based on ticket type and quantity, applying different prices for infants,
 children, and adults.
calculateSeatsToAllocate: Determines how many seats need to be reserved, excluding infant tickets (as infants do not require seats).


Why This Works
This approach ensures that ticket purchases are processed in compliance with the business rules while
 making efficient use of external services for payment and seat reservation. By validating inputs,
 the class minimizes errors, ensuring a smooth user experience and reducing the likelihood of failed transactions.


 TicketServiceImplTest Overview
 This test class validates the functionality of the TicketServiceImpl class. It uses the JUnit 5 framework along with Mockito to mock the external
 dependencies (TicketPaymentService and SeatReservationService) and ensure the core logic of ticket purchase, validation,
 and seat allocation works correctly.

 Key Tests
 testPurchaseTickets_ValidRequest: Verifies that when valid tickets are requested, the correct payment is made and the seats are reserved.
 testPurchaseTickets_InvalidAccountId: Ensures that an InvalidPurchaseException is thrown when the account ID is invalid.
 testPurchaseTickets_ExceedMaxTickets: Verifies that attempting to purchase more than 25 tickets triggers an exception.
 testPurchaseTickets_ChildOrInfantWithoutAdult: Ensures that if child or infant tickets are requested without an adult ticket, an exception is thrown.
 testCalculateTotalAmount: Tests that the total amount is correctly calculated based on the ticket types and quantities.
 testCalculateSeatsToAllocate: Verifies that the correct number of seats is allocated, excluding infants.

 Why This Works
 Each test case focuses on a specific aspect of the TicketServiceImpl functionality. This provides clear validation
 for both expected behavior (successful ticket purchase) and error scenarios (invalid input, exceeding limits).
 The mock dependencies ensure that the core logic is isolated and easily tested without external service interaction.
